# 🔐 RSA Encryption Tool (Python)

Simple RSA implementation for educational purposes

## 🌟 Features
- Text encryption/decryption
- Works with Russian letters
- Fixed values: p=5, q=11, e=7
- Easy command line interface

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roman228332/CyberLab.git
cd rsa-project
python rsa.py
```

## 💻 Example
```plaintext
> Enter text: привет
Encrypted: 1725174417
Decrypted: привет
```
